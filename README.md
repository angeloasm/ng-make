ng-make
=========

The ng-make command line utility makes it easy to make all with AngularJS.

Use the `ng-make --help` command for more detailed task information.

## Installing

```bash
$ npm install -g ng-make
```

*Note: For a global install of `-g ionic`, OSX/Linux users may need to prefix the command with `sudo` or can setup [proper file permissions on OSX for npm](http://www.johnpapa.net/how-to-use-npm-global-without-sudo-on-osx/) to install without `sudo`. *


## Create your project with AngularJS easily

```bash
$ ng-make project nameProject 
```
